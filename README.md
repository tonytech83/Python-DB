In the "Python DB" module, knowledge about PostgreSQL and popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools for handling databases with Python is acquired. The first part of the module focuses on PostgreSQL, introducing students to basic concepts in the world of databases. The module will familiarize them with one of the most widely used Database Management Systems (DBMS) in the development of modern applications - PostgreSQL. They will gain skills in working with relational databases, with emphasis on core functionalities such as working with tables, aggregate functions, transactions, procedures, etc. The second course is related to working with databases using the standard for object-oriented data modeling in Python - Django and SQLAlchemy. Students will use the knowledge accumulated so far in object-oriented programming and PostgreSQL, in order to be able to build large projects by the end of the module, navigate through them, and apply popular methodologies and best practices for code writing.
